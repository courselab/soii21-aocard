/* Notes.
   
   We declared all functions with attributes 'naked' and 'fastcall'.

   The 'naked' attribute prevents gcc from outputing asm code beyound
   what is strictly necessary for the particular example to execute.
   In particular, the otherwise extra code would be relevant if we 
   wanted our functions to exchange data using the stack; its omission
   leave us with the burden of taking care of stack integrity ourselves.
   Since this is not our case, we can play with the bare minimal
   for simplicity.

   One side effect of the 'naked' attribute is that the compiler does not
   output a 'ret' instruction by the end of the function. We have to 
   manually include it via inline asm when applicable.

   Note, for instance, that we've done that in the void function help().

   Note also that in function compare(), we needed to issue 'ret' from within
   the inline asm (since the function is naked), but had to add a 'return'
   statement as well, so that the preprocessor does not complain based on
   the function prototype. This last return is read by the preprocessor
   but is not converted to a 'ret' instruction by the compiler.

   The other attribute tells the compiler to use the fastcall convention
   to pass parameter among functions. With that, the first argument is
   passed in register %cx and the second in %dx. Further parameters would
   be passed via stack --- and since we opted for naked function, that
   would mean extra work.

   Note that when we needed the function argument to be copied into another
   register, say %bx, we used GNU extended asm to accomplish this. 
   
   Values are returned by fastcall functions in register %ax.
